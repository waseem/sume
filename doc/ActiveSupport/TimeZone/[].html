<h1>ActiveSupport::TimeZone.[]</h1>


<p>Locate a specific time zone object. If the argument is a string, it is
interpreted to mean the name of the timezone to locate. If it is a numeric
value it is either the hour offset, or the second offset, of the timezone
to find. (The first one with that offset will be returned.) Returns
<tt>nil</tt> if no such time zone is known to the system.</p>
