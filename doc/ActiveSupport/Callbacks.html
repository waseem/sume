\Callbacks are code hooks that are run at key points in an object's lifecycle.
The typical use case is to have a base class define a set of callbacks relevant
to the other functionality it supplies, so that subclasses can install callbacks
that enhance or modify the base functionality without needing to override
or redefine methods of the base class.

Mixing in this module allows you to define the events in the object's lifecycle
that will support callbacks (via +ClassMethods.define_callbacks+), set the instance
methods, procs, or callback objects to be called (via +ClassMethods.set_callback+),
and run the installed callbacks at the appropriate times (via +run_callbacks+).

Three kinds of callbacks are supported: before callbacks, run before a certain event;
after callbacks, run after the event; and around callbacks, blocks that surround the
event, triggering it when they yield. Callback code can be contained in instance
methods, procs or lambdas, or callback objects that respond to certain predetermined
methods. See +ClassMethods.set_callback+ for details.

==== Example

  class Record
    include ActiveSupport::Callbacks
    define_callbacks :save

    def save
      run_callbacks :save do
        puts "- save"
      end
    end
  end

  class PersonRecord < Record
    set_callback :save, :before, :saving_message
    def saving_message
      puts "saving..."
    end

    set_callback :save, :after do |object|
      puts "saved"
    end
  end

  person = PersonRecord.new
  person.save

Output:
  saving...
  - save
  saved
