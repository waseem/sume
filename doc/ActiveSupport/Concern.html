A typical module looks like this:

  module M
    def self.included(base)
      base.extend ClassMethods
      base.send(:include, InstanceMethods)
      scope :disabled, where(:disabled => true)
    end

    module ClassMethods
      ...
    end

    module InstanceMethods
      ...
    end
  end

By using <tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt> the above module could instead be written as:

  require 'active_support/concern'

  module M
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    included do
      scope :disabled, where(:disabled => true)
    end

    module ClassMethods
      ...
    end

    module InstanceMethods
      ...
    end
  end

Moreover, it gracefully handles module dependencies. Given a +Foo+ module and a +Bar+
module which depends on the former, we would typically write the following:

  module Foo
    def self.included(base)
      base.class_eval do
        def self.method_injected_by_foo
          ...
        end
      end
    end
  end

  module Bar
    def self.included(base)
      base.method_injected_by_foo
    end
  end

  class Host
    include Foo # We need to include this dependency for Bar
    include Bar # Bar is the module that Host really needs
  end

But why should +Host+ care about +Bar+'s dependencies, namely +Foo+? We could try to hide
these from +Host+ directly including +Foo+ in +Bar+:

  module Bar
    include Foo 
    def self.included(base)
      base.method_injected_by_foo
    end
  end

  class Host
    include Bar
  end

Unfortunately this won't work, since when +Foo+ is included, its <tt>base</tt> is the +Bar+ module,
not the +Host+ class. With <tt>ActiveSupport::Concern</tt>, module dependencies are properly resolved:

  require 'active_support/concern'

  module Foo
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern
    included do
      class_eval do
        def self.method_injected_by_foo
          ...
        end
      end
    end
  end

  module Bar
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern
    include Foo

    included do
      self.method_injected_by_foo
    end
  end

  class Host
    include Bar # works, Bar takes care now of its dependencies
  end
