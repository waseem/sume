http://www.danga.com/memcached/

This is currently the most popular cache store for production websites.

Special features:
- Clustering and load balancing. One can specify multiple memcached servers,
  and MemCacheStore will load balance between all available servers. If a
  server goes down, then MemCacheStore will ignore it until it comes back up.

MemCacheStore implements the Strategy::LocalCache strategy which implements
an in memory cache inside of a block.
