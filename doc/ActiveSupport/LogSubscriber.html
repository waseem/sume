ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber is an object set to consume ActiveSupport::Notifications
with the sole purpose of logging them. The log subscriber dispatches notifications to 
a registered object based on its given namespace.

An example would be Active Record log subscriber responsible for logging queries:

  module ActiveRecord
    class LogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
      def sql(event)
        "#{event.payload[:name]} (#{event.duration}) #{event.payload[:sql]}"
      end
    end
  end

And it's finally registered as:

  ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber.attach_to :active_record

Since we need to know all instance methods before attaching the log subscriber,
the line above should be called after your <tt>ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber</tt> definition.

After configured, whenever a "sql.active_record" notification is published,
it will properly dispatch the event (ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event) to
the sql method.

Log subscriber also has some helpers to deal with logging and automatically flushes
all logs when the request finishes (via action_dispatch.callback notification) in
a Rails environment.
