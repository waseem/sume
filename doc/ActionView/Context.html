= Action View Context

Action View contexts are supplied to Action Controller to render template.
The default Action View context is ActionView::Base.

In order to work with ActionController, a Context must just include this module.
The initialization of the variables used by the context (@output_buffer, @view_flow,
and @virtual_path) is responsibility of the object that includes this module
(although you can call _prepare_context defined below).
