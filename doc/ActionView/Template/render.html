<h1>ActionView::Template#render</h1>


<p>Render a template. If the template was not compiled yet, it is done exactly
before rendering.</p>

<p>This method is instrumented as "!render_template.action_view". Notice that
we use a bang in this instrumentation because you don't want to consume
this in production. This is only slow if it's being listened to.</p>
