<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionHandler#remove_connection</h1>


<p>Remove the connection for this class. This will close the active connection
and the defined connection (if they exist). The result can be used as an
argument for establish_connection, for easily re-establishing the
connection.</p>
