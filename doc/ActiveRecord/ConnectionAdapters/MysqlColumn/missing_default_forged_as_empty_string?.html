<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::MysqlColumn#missing_default_forged_as_empty_string?</h1>


<p>MySQL misreports NOT NULL column default when none is given. We can't
detect this for columns which may have a legitimate " default (string) but
we can for others (integer, datetime, boolean, and the rest).</p>

<p>Test whether the column has default ", is not null, and is not a type
allowing default ".</p>
