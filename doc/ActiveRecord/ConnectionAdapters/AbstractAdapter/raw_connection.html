<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#raw_connection</h1>


<p>Provides access to the underlying database driver for this adapter. For
example, this method returns a Mysql object in case of MysqlAdapter, and a
PGconn object in case of PostgreSQLAdapter.</p>

<p>This is useful for when you need to call a proprietary method such as
PostgreSQL's lo_* methods.</p>
