<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter#supports_ddl_transactions?</h1>


<p>Does this adapter support DDL rollbacks in transactions? That is, would
CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE get rolled back by a transaction? PostgreSQL,
SQL Server, and others support this. MySQL and others do not.</p>
