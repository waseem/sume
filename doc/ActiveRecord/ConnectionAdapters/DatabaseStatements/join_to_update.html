<h1>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::DatabaseStatements#join_to_update</h1>


<p>The default strategy for an UPDATE with joins is to use a subquery. This
doesn't work on mysql (even when aliasing the tables), but mysql allows
using JOIN directly in an UPDATE statement, so in the mysql adapters we
redefine this to do that.</p>
