\Fixtures are a way of organizing data that you want to test against; in short, sample data.

They are stored in YAML files, one file per model, which are placed in the directory
appointed by <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase.fixture_path=(path)</tt> (this is automatically
configured for Rails, so you can just put your files in <tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/</tt>).
The fixture file ends with the <tt>.yml</tt> file extension (Rails example:
<tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites.yml</tt>). The format of a fixture file looks
like this:

  rubyonrails:
    id: 1
    name: Ruby on Rails
    url: http://www.rubyonrails.org

  google:
    id: 2
    name: Google
    url: http://www.google.com

This fixture file includes two fixtures. Each YAML fixture (ie. record) is given a name and
is followed by an indented list of key/value pairs in the "key: value" format. Records are
separated by a blank line for your viewing pleasure.

Note that fixtures are unordered. If you want ordered fixtures, use the omap YAML type.
See http://yaml.org/type/omap.html
for the specification. You will need ordered fixtures when you have foreign key constraints
on keys in the same table. This is commonly needed for tree structures. Example:

   --- !omap
   - parent:
       id:         1
       parent_id:  NULL
       title:      Parent
   - child:
       id:         2
       parent_id:  1
       title:      Child

= Using Fixtures in Test Cases

Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests. There
are two ways to use the fixtures, but first let's take a look at a sample unit test:

  require 'test_helper'

  class WebSiteTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    test "web_site_count" do
      assert_equal 2, WebSite.count
    end
  end

By default, <tt>test_helper.rb</tt> will load all of your fixtures into your test database,
so this test will succeed.

The testing environment will automatically load the all fixtures into the database before each
test. To ensure consistent data, the environment deletes the fixtures before running the load.

In addition to being available in the database, the fixture's data may also be accessed by
using a special dynamic method, which has the same name as the model, and accepts the
name of the fixture to instantiate:

  test "find" do
    assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", web_sites(:rubyonrails).name
  end

Alternatively, you may enable auto-instantiation of the fixture data. For instance, take the
following tests:

  test "find_alt_method_1" do
    assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @web_sites['rubyonrails']['name']
  end

  test "find_alt_method_2" do
    assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @rubyonrails.news
  end

In order to use these methods to access fixtured data within your testcases, you must specify one of the
following in your <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase</tt>-derived class:

- to fully enable instantiated fixtures (enable alternate methods #1 and #2 above)
    self.use_instantiated_fixtures = true

- create only the hash for the fixtures, do not 'find' each instance (enable alternate method #1 only)
    self.use_instantiated_fixtures = :no_instances

Using either of these alternate methods incurs a performance hit, as the fixtured data must be fully
traversed in the database to create the fixture hash and/or instance variables. This is expensive for
large sets of fixtured data.

= Dynamic fixtures with ERB

Some times you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume.
In these cases, you can mix ERB in with your YAML fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load
testing, like:

  <% 1.upto(1000) do |i| %>
  fix_<%= i %>:
    id: <%= i %>
    name: guy_<%= 1 %>
  <% end %>

This will create 1000 very simple fixtures.

Using ERB, you can also inject dynamic values into your fixtures with inserts like
<tt><%= Date.today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %></tt>.
This is however a feature to be used with some caution. The point of fixtures are that they're
stable units of predictable sample data. If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then
perhaps you should reexamine whether your application is properly testable. Hence, dynamic values
in fixtures are to be considered a code smell.

= Transactional Fixtures

Test cases can use begin+rollback to isolate their changes to the database instead of having to
delete+insert for every test case.

  class FooTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
    self.use_transactional_fixtures = true

    test "godzilla" do
      assert !Foo.all.empty?
      Foo.destroy_all
      assert Foo.all.empty?
    end

    test "godzilla aftermath" do
      assert !Foo.all.empty?
    end
  end

If you preload your test database with all fixture data (probably in the rake task) and use
transactional fixtures, then you may omit all fixtures declarations in your test cases since
all the data's already there and every case rolls back its changes.

In order to use instantiated fixtures with preloaded data, set +self.pre_loaded_fixtures+ to
true. This will provide access to fixture data for every table that has been loaded through
fixtures (depending on the value of +use_instantiated_fixtures+).

When *not* to use transactional fixtures:

1. You're testing whether a transaction works correctly. Nested transactions don't commit until
   all parent transactions commit, particularly, the fixtures transaction which is begun in setup
   and rolled back in teardown. Thus, you won't be able to verify
   the results of your transaction until Active Record supports nested transactions or savepoints (in progress).
2. Your database does not support transactions. Every Active Record database supports transactions except MySQL MyISAM.
   Use InnoDB, MaxDB, or NDB instead.

= Advanced Fixtures

Fixtures that don't specify an ID get some extra features:

* Stable, autogenerated IDs
* Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
* HABTM associations as inline lists
* Autofilled timestamp columns
* Fixture label interpolation
* Support for YAML defaults

== Stable, Autogenerated IDs

Here, have a monkey fixture:

  george:
    id: 1
    name: George the Monkey

  reginald:
    id: 2
    name: Reginald the Pirate

Each of these fixtures has two unique identifiers: one for the database
and one for the humans. Why don't we generate the primary key instead?
Hashing each fixture's label yields a consistent ID:

  george: # generated id: 503576764
    name: George the Monkey

  reginald: # generated id: 324201669
    name: Reginald the Pirate

Active Record looks at the fixture's model class, discovers the correct
primary key, and generates it right before inserting the fixture
into the database.

The generated ID for a given label is constant, so we can discover
any fixture's ID without loading anything, as long as we know the label.

== Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)

Specifying foreign keys in fixtures can be very fragile, not to
mention difficult to read. Since Active Record can figure out the ID of
any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.

=== belongs_to

Let's break out some more monkeys and pirates.

  ### in pirates.yml

  reginald:
    id: 1
    name: Reginald the Pirate
    monkey_id: 1

  ### in monkeys.yml

  george:
    id: 1
    name: George the Monkey
    pirate_id: 1

Add a few more monkeys and pirates and break this into multiple files,
and it gets pretty hard to keep track of what's going on. Let's
use labels instead of IDs:

  ### in pirates.yml

  reginald:
    name: Reginald the Pirate
    monkey: george

  ### in monkeys.yml

  george:
    name: George the Monkey
    pirate: reginald

Pow! All is made clear. Active Record reflects on the fixture's model class,
finds all the +belongs_to+ associations, and allows you to specify
a target *label* for the *association* (monkey: george) rather than
a target *id* for the *FK* (<tt>monkey_id: 1</tt>).

==== Polymorphic belongs_to

Supporting polymorphic relationships is a little bit more complicated, since
Active Record needs to know what type your association is pointing at. Something
like this should look familiar:

  ### in fruit.rb

  belongs_to :eater, :polymorphic => true

  ### in fruits.yml

  apple:
    id: 1
    name: apple
    eater_id: 1
    eater_type: Monkey

Can we do better? You bet!

  apple:
    eater: george (Monkey)

Just provide the polymorphic target type and Active Record will take care of the rest.

=== has_and_belongs_to_many

Time to give our monkey some fruit.

  ### in monkeys.yml

  george:
    id: 1
    name: George the Monkey

  ### in fruits.yml

  apple:
    id: 1
    name: apple

  orange:
    id: 2
    name: orange

  grape:
    id: 3
    name: grape

  ### in fruits_monkeys.yml

  apple_george:
    fruit_id: 1
    monkey_id: 1

  orange_george:
    fruit_id: 2
    monkey_id: 1

  grape_george:
    fruit_id: 3
    monkey_id: 1

Let's make the HABTM fixture go away.

  ### in monkeys.yml

  george:
    id: 1
    name: George the Monkey
    fruits: apple, orange, grape

  ### in fruits.yml

  apple:
    name: apple

  orange:
    name: orange

  grape:
    name: grape

Zap! No more fruits_monkeys.yml file. We've specified the list of fruits
on George's fixture, but we could've just as easily specified a list
of monkeys on each fruit. As with +belongs_to+, Active Record reflects on
the fixture's model class and discovers the +has_and_belongs_to_many+
associations.

== Autofilled Timestamp Columns

If your table/model specifies any of Active Record's
standard timestamp columns (+created_at+, +created_on+, +updated_at+, +updated_on+),
they will automatically be set to <tt>Time.now</tt>.

If you've set specific values, they'll be left alone.

== Fixture label interpolation

The label of the current fixture is always available as a column value:

  geeksomnia:
    name: Geeksomnia's Account
    subdomain: $LABEL

Also, sometimes (like when porting older join table fixtures) you'll need
to be able to get a hold of the identifier for a given label. ERB
to the rescue:

  george_reginald:
    monkey_id: <%= ActiveRecord::Fixtures.identify(:reginald) %>
    pirate_id: <%= ActiveRecord::Fixtures.identify(:george) %>

== Support for YAML defaults

You probably already know how to use YAML to set and reuse defaults in
your <tt>database.yml</tt> file. You can use the same technique in your fixtures:

  DEFAULTS: &DEFAULTS
    created_on: <%= 3.weeks.ago.to_s(:db) %>

  first:
    name: Smurf
    *DEFAULTS

  second:
    name: Fraggle
    *DEFAULTS

Any fixture labeled "DEFAULTS" is safely ignored.
