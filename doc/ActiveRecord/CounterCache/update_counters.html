<h1>ActiveRecord::CounterCache#update_counters</h1>


<p>A generic "counter updater" implementation, intended primarily to be used
by increment_counter and decrement_counter, but which may also be useful on
its own. It simply does a direct SQL update for the record with the given
ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount given by the
corresponding value:</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<ul><li>
<p><tt>id</tt> - The id of the object you wish to update a counter on or an
Array of ids.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt>counters</tt> - An Array of Hashes containing the names of the fields
to update as keys and the amount to update the field by as values.</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre># For the Post with id of 5, decrement the comment_count by 1, and
# increment the action_count by 1
Post.update_counters 5, :comment_count =&gt; -1, :action_count =&gt; 1
# Executes the following SQL:
# UPDATE posts
#    SET comment_count = COALESCE(comment_count, 0) - 1,
#        action_count = COALESCE(action_count, 0) + 1
#  WHERE id = 5

# For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comment_count by 1
Post.update_counters [10, 15], :comment_count =&gt; 1
# Executes the following SQL:
# UPDATE posts
#    SET comment_count = COALESCE(comment_count, 0) + 1,
#  WHERE id IN (10, 15)</pre>
