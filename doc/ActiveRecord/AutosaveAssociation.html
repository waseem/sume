= Active Record Autosave Association

+AutosaveAssociation+ is a module that takes care of automatically saving
associated records when their parent is saved. In addition to saving, it
also destroys any associated records that were marked for destruction.
(See +mark_for_destruction+ and <tt>marked_for_destruction?</tt>).

Saving of the parent, its associations, and the destruction of marked
associations, all happen inside a transaction. This should never leave the
database in an inconsistent state.

If validations for any of the associations fail, their error messages will
be applied to the parent.

Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't
be destroyed directly. They will however still be marked for destruction.

Note that <tt>:autosave => false</tt> is not same as not declaring <tt>:autosave</tt>.
When the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is not present new associations are saved.

=== One-to-one Example

  class Post
    has_one :author, :autosave => true
  end

Saving changes to the parent and its associated model can now be performed
automatically _and_ atomically:

  post = Post.find(1)
  post.title       # => "The current global position of migrating ducks"
  post.author.name # => "alloy"

  post.title = "On the migration of ducks"
  post.author.name = "Eloy Duran"

  post.save
  post.reload
  post.title       # => "On the migration of ducks"
  post.author.name # => "Eloy Duran"

Destroying an associated model, as part of the parent's save action, is as
simple as marking it for destruction:

  post.author.mark_for_destruction
  post.author.marked_for_destruction? # => true

Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:

  id = post.author.id
  Author.find_by_id(id).nil? # => false

  post.save
  post.reload.author # => nil

Now it _is_ removed from the database:

  Author.find_by_id(id).nil? # => true

=== One-to-many Example

When <tt>:autosave</tt> is not declared new children are saved when their parent is saved:

  class Post
    has_many :comments # :autosave option is no declared
  end

  post = Post.new(:title => 'ruby rocks')
  post.comments.build(:body => 'hello world')
  post.save # => saves both post and comment

  post = Post.create(:title => 'ruby rocks')
  post.comments.build(:body => 'hello world')
  post.save # => saves both post and comment

  post = Post.create(:title => 'ruby rocks')
  post.comments.create(:body => 'hello world')
  post.save # => saves both post and comment

When <tt>:autosave</tt> is true all children is saved, no matter whether they are new records:

  class Post
    has_many :comments, :autosave => true
  end

  post = Post.create(:title => 'ruby rocks')
  post.comments.create(:body => 'hello world')
  post.comments[0].body = 'hi everyone'
  post.save # => saves both post and comment, with 'hi everyone' as body

Destroying one of the associated models as part of the parent's save action
is as simple as marking it for destruction:

  post.comments.last.mark_for_destruction
  post.comments.last.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  post.comments.length # => 2

Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:

  id = post.comments.last.id
  Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # => false

  post.save
  post.reload.comments.length # => 1

Now it _is_ removed from the database:

  Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # => true

=== Validation

Children records are validated unless <tt>:validate</tt> is +false+.
