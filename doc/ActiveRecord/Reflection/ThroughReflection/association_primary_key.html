<h1>ActiveRecord::Reflection::ThroughReflection#association_primary_key</h1>


<p>We want to use the klass from this reflection, rather than just delegate
straight to the source_reflection, because the source_reflection may be
polymorphic. We still need to respect the source_reflection's :primary_key
option, though.</p>
