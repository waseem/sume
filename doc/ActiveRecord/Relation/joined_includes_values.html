<h1>ActiveRecord::Relation#joined_includes_values</h1>


<p>Joins that are also marked for preloading. In which case we should just
eager load them. Note that this is a naive implementation because we could
have strings and symbols which represent the same association, but that
aren't matched by this. Also, we could have nested hashes which partially
match, e.g. { :a =&gt; :b } &amp; { :a =&gt; [:b, :c] }</p>
