Active Record implements aggregation through a macro-like class method called +composed_of+
for representing attributes  as value objects. It expresses relationships like "Account [is]
composed of Money [among other things]" or "Person [is] composed of [an] address". Each call
to the macro adds a description of how the value objects  are created from the attributes of
the entity object (when the entity is initialized either  as a new object or from finding an
existing object) and how it can be turned back into attributes  (when the entity is saved to
the database).

  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    composed_of :balance, :class_name => "Money", :mapping => %w(balance amount)
    composed_of :address, :mapping => [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
  end

The customer class now has the following methods to manipulate the value objects:
* <tt>Customer#balance, Customer#balance=(money)</tt>
* <tt>Customer#address, Customer#address=(address)</tt>

These methods will operate with value objects like the ones described below:

 class Money
   include Comparable
   attr_reader :amount, :currency
   EXCHANGE_RATES = { "USD_TO_DKK" => 6 }

   def initialize(amount, currency = "USD")
     @amount, @currency = amount, currency
   end

   def exchange_to(other_currency)
     exchanged_amount = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATES["#currency_TO_#other_currency"]).floor
     Money.new(exchanged_amount, other_currency)
   end

   def ==(other_money)
     amount == other_money.amount && currency == other_money.currency
   end

   def <=>(other_money)
     if currency == other_money.currency
       amount <=> amount
     else
       amount <=> other_money.exchange_to(currency).amount
     end
   end
 end

 class Address
   attr_reader :street, :city
   def initialize(street, city)
     @street, @city = street, city
   end

   def close_to?(other_address)
     city == other_address.city
   end

   def ==(other_address)
     city == other_address.city && street == other_address.street
   end
 end

Now it's possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead. If
you choose to name the composition the same as the attribute's name, it will be the only way to
access that attribute. That's the case with our +balance+ attribute. You interact with the value
objects just like you would any other attribute, though:

  customer.balance = Money.new(20)     # sets the Money value object and the attribute
  customer.balance                     # => Money value object
  customer.balance.exchange_to("DKK")  # => Money.new(120, "DKK")
  customer.balance > Money.new(10)     # => true
  customer.balance == Money.new(20)    # => true
  customer.balance < Money.new(5)      # => false

Value objects can also be composed of multiple attributes, such as the case of Address. The order
of the mappings will determine the order of the parameters.

  customer.address_street = "Hyancintvej"
  customer.address_city   = "Copenhagen"
  customer.address        # => Address.new("Hyancintvej", "Copenhagen")
  customer.address = Address.new("May Street", "Chicago")
  customer.address_street # => "May Street"
  customer.address_city   # => "Chicago"

== Writing value objects

Value objects are immutable and interchangeable objects that represent a given value, such as
a Money object representing $5. Two Money objects both representing $5 should be equal (through
methods such as <tt>==</tt> and <tt><=></tt> from Comparable if ranking makes sense). This is
unlike entity objects where equality is determined by identity. An entity class such as Customer can
easily have two different objects that both have an address on Hyancintvej. Entity identity is
determined by object or relational unique identifiers (such as primary keys). Normal
ActiveRecord::Base classes are entity objects.

It's also important to treat the value objects as immutable. Don't allow the Money object to have
its amount changed after creation. Create a new Money object with the new value instead. This
is exemplified by the Money#exchange_to method that returns a new value object instead of changing
its own values. Active Record won't persist value objects that have been changed through means
other than the writer method.

The immutable requirement is enforced by Active Record by freezing any object assigned as a value
object. Attempting to change it afterwards will result in a ActiveSupport::FrozenObjectError.

== Custom constructors and converters

By default value objects are initialized by calling the <tt>new</tt> constructor of the value
class passing each of the mapped attributes, in the order specified by the <tt>:mapping</tt>
option, as arguments. If the value class doesn't support this convention then +composed_of+ allows
a custom constructor to be specified.

When a new value is assigned to the value object the default assumption is that the new value
is an instance of the value class. Specifying a custom converter allows the new value to be automatically
converted to an instance of value class if necessary.

For example, the NetworkResource model has +network_address+ and +cidr_range+ attributes that
should be aggregated using the NetAddr::CIDR value class (http://netaddr.rubyforge.org). The constructor
for the value class is called +create+ and it expects a CIDR address string as a parameter. New
values can be assigned to the value object using either another NetAddr::CIDR object, a string
or an array. The <tt>:constructor</tt> and <tt>:converter</tt> options can be used to meet
these requirements:

  class NetworkResource < ActiveRecord::Base
    composed_of :cidr,
                :class_name => 'NetAddr::CIDR',
                :mapping => [ %w(network_address network), %w(cidr_range bits) ],
                :allow_nil => true,
                :constructor => Proc.new { |network_address, cidr_range| NetAddr::CIDR.create("#network_address/#cidr_range") },
                :converter => Proc.new { |value| NetAddr::CIDR.create(value.is_a?(Array) ? value.join('/') : value) }
  end

  # This calls the :constructor
  network_resource = NetworkResource.new(:network_address => '192.168.0.1', :cidr_range => 24)

  # These assignments will both use the :converter
  network_resource.cidr = [ '192.168.2.1', 8 ]
  network_resource.cidr = '192.168.0.1/24'

  # This assignment won't use the :converter as the value is already an instance of the value class
  network_resource.cidr = NetAddr::CIDR.create('192.168.2.1/8')

  # Saving and then reloading will use the :constructor on reload
  network_resource.save
  network_resource.reload

== Finding records by a value object

Once a +composed_of+ relationship is specified for a model, records can be loaded from the database
by specifying an instance of the value object in the conditions hash. The following example
finds all customers with +balance_amount+ equal to 20 and +balance_currency+ equal to "USD":

  Customer.where(:balance => Money.new(20, "USD")).all
