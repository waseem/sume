<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#association_scope</h1>


<p>The scope for this association.</p>

<p>Note that the association_scope is merged into the target_scope only when
the scoped method is called. This is because at that point the call may be
surrounded by scope.scoping { ... } or with_scope { ... } etc, which
affects the scope which actually gets built.</p>
