<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#stale_target?</h1>


<p>The target is stale if the target no longer points to the record(s) that
the relevant foreign_key(s) refers to. If stale, the association accessor
method on the owner will reload the target. It's up to subclasses to
implement the state_state method if relevant.</p>

<p>Note that if the target has not been loaded, it is not considered stale.</p>
