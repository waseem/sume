<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#foreign_key_present?</h1>


<p>Should be true if there is a foreign key present on the owner which
references the target. This is used to determine whether we can load the
target if the owner is currently a new record (and therefore without a
key).</p>

<p>Currently implemented by belongs_to (vanilla and polymorphic) and
has_one/has_many :through associations which go through a belongs_to</p>
