<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::Association#stale_state</h1>


<p>This should be implemented to return the values of the relevant key(s) on
the owner, so that when state_state is different from the value stored on
the last find_target, the target is stale.</p>

<p>This is only relevant to certain associations, which is why it returns nil
by default.</p>
