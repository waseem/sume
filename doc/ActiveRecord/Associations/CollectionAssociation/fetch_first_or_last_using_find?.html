<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionAssociation#fetch_first_or_last_using_find?</h1>


<p>Should we deal with assoc.first or assoc.last by issuing an independent
query to the database, or by getting the target, and then taking the
first/last item from that?</p>

<p>If the args is just a non-empty options hash, go to the database.</p>

<p>Otherwise, go to the database only if none of the following are true:</p>

<pre data-language="ruby">* target already loaded
* owner is new record
* custom :finder_sql exists
* target contains new or changed record(s)
* the first arg is an integer (which indicates the number of records to be returned)</pre>
