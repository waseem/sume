<h1>ActiveRecord::Associations::HasOneAssociation#set_new_record</h1>


<p>The reason that the save param for replace is false, if for create (not
just build), is because the setting of the foreign keys is actually handled
by the scoping when the record is instantiated, and so they are set
straight away and do not need to be updated within replace.</p>
