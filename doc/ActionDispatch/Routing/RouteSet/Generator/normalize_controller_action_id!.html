<h1>ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet::Generator#normalize_controller_action_id!</h1>


<p>This pulls :controller, :action, and :id out of the recall. The recall key
is only used if there is no key in the options or if the key in the options
is identical. If any of :controller, :action or :id is not found, don't
pull any more keys from the recall.</p>
