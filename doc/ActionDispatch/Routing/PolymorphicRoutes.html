Polymorphic URL helpers are methods for smart resolution to a named route call when
given an Active Record model instance. They are to be used in combination with
ActionController::Resources.

These methods are useful when you want to generate correct URL or path to a RESTful
resource without having to know the exact type of the record in question.

Nested resources and/or namespaces are also supported, as illustrated in the example:

  polymorphic_url([:admin, @article, @comment])

results in:

  admin_article_comment_url(@article, @comment)

== Usage within the framework

Polymorphic URL helpers are used in a number of places throughout the \Rails framework:

* <tt>url_for</tt>, so you can use it with a record as the argument, e.g.
  <tt>url_for(@article)</tt>;
* ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper uses <tt>polymorphic_path</tt>, so you can write
  <tt>form_for(@article)</tt> without having to specify <tt>:url</tt> parameter for the form
  action;
* <tt>redirect_to</tt> (which, in fact, uses <tt>url_for</tt>) so you can write
  <tt>redirect_to(post)</tt> in your controllers;
* ActionView::Helpers::AtomFeedHelper, so you don't have to explicitly specify URLs
  for feed entries.

== Prefixed polymorphic helpers

In addition to <tt>polymorphic_url</tt> and <tt>polymorphic_path</tt> methods, a
number of prefixed helpers are available as a shorthand to <tt>:action => "..."</tt>
in options. Those are:

* <tt>edit_polymorphic_url</tt>, <tt>edit_polymorphic_path</tt>
* <tt>new_polymorphic_url</tt>, <tt>new_polymorphic_path</tt>

Example usage:

  edit_polymorphic_path(@post)              # => "/posts/1/edit"
  polymorphic_path(@post, :format => :pdf)  # => "/posts/1.pdf"

== Using with mounted engines

If you use mounted engine, there is a possibility that you will need to use
polymorphic_url pointing at engine's routes. To do that, just pass proxy used
to reach engine's routes as a first argument:

For example:

polymorphic_url([blog, @post])  # it will call blog.post_path(@post)
form_for([blog, @post])         # => "/blog/posts/1
