<h1>ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers#request_via_redirect</h1>


<p>Performs a request using the specified method, following any subsequent
redirect. Note that the redirects are followed until the response is not a
redirect--this means you may run into an infinite loop if your redirect
loops back to itself.</p>
