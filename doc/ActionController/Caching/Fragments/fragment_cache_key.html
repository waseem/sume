<h1>ActionController::Caching::Fragments#fragment_cache_key</h1>


<p>Given a key (as described in <tt>expire_fragment</tt>), returns a key
suitable for use in reading, writing, or expiring a  cached fragment. If
the key is a hash, the generated key is the return value of url_for on that
hash (without the protocol).  All keys are prefixed with <tt>views/</tt>
and uses ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key for the expansion.</p>
