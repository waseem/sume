<h1>ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Digest#validate_nonce</h1>


<p>Might want a shorter timeout depending on whether the request is a PUT or
POST, and if client is browser or web service. Can be much shorter if the
Stale directive is implemented. This would allow a user to use new nonce
without prompting user again for their username and password.</p>
