Wraps the parameters hash into a nested hash. This will allow clients to submit
POST requests without having to specify any root elements.

This functionality is enabled in +config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb+
and can be customized. If you are upgrading to \Rails 3.1, this file will
need to be created for the functionality to be enabled.

You could also turn it on per controller by setting the format array to
a non-empty array:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      wrap_parameters :format => [:json, :xml]
    end

If you enable +ParamsWrapper+ for +:json+ format, instead of having to
send JSON parameters like this:

    {"name": "Konata"}

You can send parameters like this:

    "Konata"

And it will be wrapped into a nested hash with the key name matching the
controller's name. For example, if you're posting to +UsersController+,
your new +params+ hash will look like this:

    => "Konata", "user" => {"name" => "Konata"}

You can also specify the key in which the parameters should be wrapped to,
and also the list of attributes it should wrap by using either +:include+ or
+:exclude+ options like this:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      wrap_parameters :person, :include => [:username, :password]
    end

If you're going to pass the parameters to an +ActiveModel+ object (such as
+User.new(params[:user])+), you might consider passing the model class to
the method instead. The +ParamsWrapper+ will actually try to determine the
list of attribute names from the model and only wrap those attributes:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      wrap_parameters Person
    end

You still could pass +:include+ and +:exclude+ to set the list of attributes
you want to wrap.

By default, if you don't specify the key in which the parameters would be
wrapped to, +ParamsWrapper+ will actually try to determine if there's
a model related to it or not. This controller, for example:

    class Admin::UsersController < ApplicationController
    end

will try to check if +Admin::User+ or +User+ model exists, and use it to
determine the wrapper key respectively. If both models don't exist,
it will then fallback to use +user+ as the key.
