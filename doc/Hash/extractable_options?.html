<h1>Hash#extractable_options?</h1>


<p>By default, only instances of Hash itself are extractable. Subclasses of
Hash may implement this method and return true to declare themselves as
extractable. If a Hash is extractable, Array#extract_options! pops it from
the Array when it is the last element of the Array.</p>
